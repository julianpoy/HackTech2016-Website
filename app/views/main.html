    <p>
        The File Menu is where you will access audio files on your local machine.

        To open a folder, click the "Open Folder" button placed near the top of
        the scrollable folder menu. Which will prompt a folder chooser dialog
        which you can then choose a folder containing your files

        Folders are displayed as: [Folder Name Here], and files are displayed
        by their file name.

        Click a folder to expand it and enter it's directory, and click a file to
        add it to the Loop View described below.

        NOTE: You may only go three directories deep into a folder structure at a
        time before the app will no longer display inner directory files.

    <!-- Loop View -->
    <h3 class = "center">Loop View</h3>

    <div class = "headerImageContainer">
        <img src = "../images/tutorial-loopView.png"
        alt = "File Menu Screenshot"
        class = "center">
    </div>

    <p>
        The Loop View is where audio files will be played, looped, and manipulated
        on an individual basis.

        Click the title of the audio to begin looping and set it to "Playing". Click
        the title again to stop it from playing and looping.

        While the track is playing, there will be a counter that displays the remaining
        time left before the audio loops.

        There are two sliders for individual track manipulation. Track Volume, and Playback Speed.

        Track volume will raise or lower the track's volume as the slider increases and decreses.
        And the Playback Speed will increase or decrease as the Slider increases or decreases.

        <img src = "../images/tutorial-masterEffects.png"
        alt = "File Menu Screenshot"
        class = "center">
    </div>

    <p>
        The Master Effects are a collections of sliders that will manipulate the audio
        of ALL playing audio tracks

        "Volume" will manipulate the overall volume of all audio playing.

        "Playback Speed" will manipulate the overall speed of all audio playing.

        "Delay" will add a delay effect to all audio playing.

        "Reverb" will add reverberation to all audio currently playing.

        "Lowpass Filter" will manipulate the frequency of the Low Pass filter that is applied to
        all audio playing.

        NOTE: Currently Volume And Playback Speed will affect the individual audio volume
        as well as the master volume, so this should be used only when one audio loop is being
        played. To avoid any mistakes or confusion.
